    git reset --hard origin/<current branchName>
        (i.e.) if you accidently merged feature1 >> feature2
            username /path/to/repo/ (feature2)
            $ git status
            On branch feature2
            your branch is ahead of origin.
            use get push

            this is where you would use 'git reset --hard origin/feature2'
            which will remove all changes and set your branch at the same state as the remote
